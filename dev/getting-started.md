# Getting Started

## Installation

To embed the Guidr widget into your application and interact with it, follow these steps:

1. In the sidebar, click on **Widgets** to open the widget overview.  
2. Select the widget you want to integrate.  
3. Navigate to the **Embed** tab.  
4. Copy the provided code snippet.  
5. Paste the snippet into your application – preferably **right before the closing `</body>` tag**.  
   - Alternatively, you can also place it inside the `<head>` if you want the widget to be available immediately on page load.  

Once the snippet is embedded, the global **`window.guidr`** object becomes available.  
You’ll later use this object to interact with the widget through hooks and functions.
