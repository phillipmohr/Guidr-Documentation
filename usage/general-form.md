# Create Your Widget: General Form

The **General Form** contains the basic settings for your widget.

- **Published**  
  Decide whether the widget is active and visible to your users.

- **Title**  
  The title of your widget. Example: *Onboarding Tour*. Visible to your users.

- **Short Description**  
  A short explanation of the widget. This will also be shown inside the widget for your users.

**Presentation Settings**

- **Show Widget on Page Load**  
  If enabled, the widget opens automatically when the page loads (unless the user has previously closed it).

- **Display Mode**  
  Defines how the widget is shown on your site:  
  1. **Inline Embed** – Render the tour directly inside any element using a DOM selector (e.g. `#my-div`).  
  2. **Floating Button (Prebuilt)** – Add a floating button to your site that opens the widget on click. No setup needed.  
  3. **Floating Button (Custom Trigger)** – Use your own button and connect it via a DOM selector to open the widget in floating mode.

- **Trigger Button Text**  
  The text displayed on the floating button. Example: *Take a tour*.

- **Position**  
  Configure if the floating widget should be shown on the bottom left or bottom right.
