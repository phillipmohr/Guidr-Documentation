# Create Your Widget: Embed

Once your widget is configured, you can embed it on your website.  
Just copy the provided `<script>` tag and paste it between the `<body>` tags of your site.

## Embed Code

- **src**  
  Loads the Guidr widget script from our server.

- **data-ids**  
  The unique widget ID(s) you want to embed.  
  - You can pass one ID, for example `51`.  
  - Or multiple, separated by commas, e.g. `51,52,53`.

## Where to place the code

- Insert the script tag **before the closing `</body>` tag** of your website.  
- Make sure it is included on every page where you want the widget to be available.

## Preview

On the right side of the Embed tab, youâ€™ll always see a live preview of your widget, so you can check how it looks before publishing.

## That's it! You created your first Product Tour ðŸŽ‰
