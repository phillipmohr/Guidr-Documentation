# Getting Started with Guidr

Guidr helps you create interactive product tours for your app or website.  
Even if you’re not technical, you can set up your first onboarding widget in just a few minutes.  

## What is Guidr?

Guidr is a tool to guide your users step by step.  
With widgets like **pop-ups, inline helpers, and progress bars**, you can highlight important features and make sure users don’t miss key actions.

- **No coding required** (but you can add advanced options if you want)
- **Custom branding** so the widget matches your app
- **Analytics** to see how many users complete your tour

## Create Your First Widget

1. Go to your **Dashboard** → click **New Widget**  
2. Give your widget a **name** (e.g. "Onboarding Tour")  

On the edit page, **you’ll find 5 tabs**. Here’s a quick overview:

- **General:** Set the title, description, and choose how you want to display the widget (Inline or Floating Widget), plus other options.  
- **Steps:** Add groups and steps to guide users. Define when a step should be considered complete.  
- **Branding:** Hide the Guidr branding at the bottom of the widget, and customize colors and corner radius.  
- **Analytics:** Track how many users viewed your tour, interacted with it, and completed it.  
- **Embed:** Copy & paste a lightweight script (~3KB gzipped) into your app.  

## FAQ

**Do I need to know code?**  
No – Guidr works without coding. Developers can optionally configure advanced triggers.  

**What is a DOM selector?**  
That’s just the “name” of an element on your site (e.g. a button). If you’re not sure, ask your developer.

**Can I run multiple widgets at the same time?**  
Yes, you can create and activate several tours on different pages.  

**Does it work in single-page apps (SPA)?**  
Yes – Guidr listens to page changes even without full reloads.
